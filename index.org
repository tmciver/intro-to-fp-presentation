* What is Functional Programming?

** 
It's a bit hard to define, but let's give it a go.

** 
#+begin_quote
"functional programming can be viewed as a /style/ of programming in which the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments."

-- Graham Hutton, author of "Programming in Haskell"
#+end_quote

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
There must be more to the story than that . . .

Wikipedia says:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
# #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Wikipedia Logo :title Wikipedia Logo
# [[file:./img/220px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png]]
"Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data."
#+END_QUOTE
#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Purely functional programming may also be defined by forbidding changing-state and mutable data.
#+END_QUOTE

First-class Functions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Functional programming languages are often said to be those where functions are "first class".
- This means that functions are values like any other and can therefore be passed as arguments to other functions or returned from functions.

** First-Class Function Examples: JavaScript
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+begin_src js :results pp
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("hello");
}, 3000);
#+end_src

#+HEADER: :exports both
#+begin_src js :results pp
var greeter = function(greeting) {
  return function(name) {
    console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
  };
}
var helloGreeter = greeter("Hello")
helloGreeter("FP fans!")
#+end_src

** It is: an example of the declarative paradigm
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- i.e., it is based on the use of expressions or declarations
- contrasts with the imperative paradigm (the use of statements to change program state)

** Example: imperative
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
# Python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']
upper_chars = []
for c in chars:
  upper_chars.append(c.upper())

return upper_chars
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

** Example: functional
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
# Python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']
upper_chars = [c.upper() for c in chars]

return upper_chars
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Example: expressions vs. statements
In imperative languages, ~if~ / ~else~ is a statement:
#+begin_src java
// Java
String msg = "";
if (isMoving) {
  msg = "We're moving!";
} else {
  msg = "We're stopped.";
}
#+end_src
In functional languages, it's an expression.
#+begin_src scala
// Scala
val msg: String = if (isMoving)
                    "We're moving!"
                  else "We're stopped."
#+end_src

** Functions as First-class Citizens
(Higher Order Functions)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Functions returning functions
- Functions as function arguments

** Immutability
** Totality
** Referential Transparency
** No Side Effects
*** Always safe to evaluate independent expressions in parallel
*** Be sure to point out how many of the mathematical properties of FP are only true if there are no side effects.
** Category Theory
** Laziness

* Examples

* Uses in Industry
** Facebooks Spam Filters Written in Haskell
** WhatsApp Written in Erlang
** Some of Twitter (what parts?) Written in Scala
** Jane Street uses OCaml
** Github uses Haskell for "semantic" application
