* What is Functional Programming?

** It is:
- an example of the declarative paradigm - meaning that it is based on the use of expressions or declarations
- usually contrasted with the imperative paradigm (the use of statements to change program state)

** Example (Imperative)
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
# Python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']
upper_chars = []
for c in chars:
  upper_chars.append(c.upper())

return upper_chars
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

** Example (functional)
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
# Python
chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']
upper_chars = [c.upper() for c in chars]

return upper_chars
#+END_SRC

"Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Purely functional programming may also be defined by forbidding changing-state and mutable data.

** Functions as First-class Citizens
(Higher Order Functions)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Functions returning functions
- Functions as function arguments

** Immutability
** Totality
** Referential Transparency
** No Side Effects
*** Always safe to evaluate independent expressions in parallel
** Category Theory

* What is it Good For?

** Computer-assisted optimizations
** Computer-assisted parallelization

* Examples

* Uses in Industry
** Facebooks Spam Filters Written in Haskell
** WhatsApp Written in Erlang
** Some of Twitter (what parts?) Written in Scala
** Jane Street uses OCaml
** Github uses Haskell for "semantic" application

* Conclusion
