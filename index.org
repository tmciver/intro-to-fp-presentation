"Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data."

Purely functional programming may also be defined by forbidding changing-state and mutable data.

** Functions as First-class Citizens
(Higher Order Functions)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Functions returning functions
- Functions as function arguments

** Example: `map`
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
# Python
def to_upper_case(s):
  return str(s).upper()

return map(to_upper_case, 'abc')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| A | B | C |

** Immutability
** Totality
** Referential Transparency
** No Side Effects
*** Always safe to evaluate independent expressions in parallel
** Category Theory

** Computer-assisted optimizations
** Computer-assisted parallelization

* Examples

* Uses in Industry
** Facebooks Spam Filters Written in Haskell
** WhatsApp Written in Erlang
** Some of Twitter (what parts?) Written in Scala
** Jane Street uses OCaml
** Github uses Haskell for "semantic" application

* Conclusion
